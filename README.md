I've written a bookmarklet for searching OpenShift's Bugzilla.
GitHub strips JavaScript links from their rendered pages to prevent nasty things, so you'll need to jump through some hoops to get it into your browser.
For example, you can download [`bugzilla.html`](bugzilla.html), open the downloaded file in your browser, and bookmark the "OpenShift Bugzilla" link.
Then follow the `bugzilla.html` directions to use the bookmarklet.
Happy hunting :).
